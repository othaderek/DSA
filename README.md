# Data Strucutures and Algorithms in C#

## Description

These are my Data Structures and Algorithms implementations in C# to better prepare myself for the grueling interview process. I will be gradually adding and making improvements to my entries here. My plan is to add explanations, implementations, and which data strucutures and algorithms one might use to solve common interview problems.
