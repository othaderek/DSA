# Data Strucutures and Algorithms in C#

## Description

These are my Data Structures and Algorithms implementations in C# to better prepare myself for the grueling interview process. I will be gradually adding and making improvements to my entries here. My plan is to add explanations, implementations, and which data strucutures and algorithms one might use to solve common interview problems.

## Data Strucutures

### Arrays

An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together.

An array of integers in C# looks like this:
` int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; `

Each item in an array has an index. The first index of the array is always 0 and the last index of the array is always the arrays length - 1.


#### Common Operations

Access: *O(1)*

Accessing is as simple as passing in the index of an array to square brackets. Consider our array from above.
` arr[0] == 1 `

Search: *O(n)*

Insertion: *O(n)*

Deletion: *O(n)*
